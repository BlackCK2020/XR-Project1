## Point implementation:

- [x]  Virtual navigation by touch pad using gliding/flying metaphor

- [ ] Manipulation with ray casting at an offset distance or a virtual hand for close-up manipulation
  * Failed. Interaction with button b on left touch pad.

- [x] Activation / Deactivation of objects during runtime
  * Interaction with button b to crash the Dinosaur skeleton

- [x] Canvas + 3D TextMeshPro
  * Implemented on dinosaur descriptions

- [x] Physics
  * Implemented on dinosaur bone crashing fall

- [ ] Lighting controlled during the interaction
  - [ ] Failed. 

- [x] 3D audio integrated in the scene

- [x] Timer that counts down the time
  * On top right corner

- [x] Scripting of object behaviours and logics in the scene
  * Dinosaur bone interaction
